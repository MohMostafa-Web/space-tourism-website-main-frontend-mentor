## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties [Varaibles, Mixins , Media Queries, Components]
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure JS

### What I learned

- It's a good practice to create multiple pages using Sass

- Also very useful to practice on making responsive designs

### Continued development

In the future, I will use more css preprocessors like sass and more frameworks like bootstrap, angula or react js.

### Useful resources

- [youtube playlist (Create Web Design With Sass)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAz9sluuyOWPifXvySgrGma8) - This is an amazing channel which helped me and this playlist helped me to understand Sass. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this channel.
